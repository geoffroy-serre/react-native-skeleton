# react-native-skeleton

This skeleton use expo.
React Native skeleton with eslint configured.

Some options are commented in eslint config file. Feel free to comment more or uncomment those you want to use.

Prettier isn't setted here, as I use VSCode extension for prettier and it is configured in it.
If you're not alone on your project, it's recommended to have prettier's configuration in your project, to standardize the code rules between developpers.
